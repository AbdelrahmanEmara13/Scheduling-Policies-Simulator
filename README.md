# Scheduling-Policies-Simulator
Implementation of task scheduler using C/C++ for the following scheduling policies: 
1- Non-Preemptive First Come First Serve 
2- Round Robin (with quantum to be set as input) 
3- Shortest Job First 
4- Shortest Remaining Time First 
5- Real Time Earliest Deadline First

In process.txt, the first col represents the process ID, 2d col represents AT, 3rd col represents BT, while the 4th represents the Deadline

Run it using the following command: g++ TS.cpp -o TS && ./TS
